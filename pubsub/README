0) Change the keyfile to your own key file (DO NOT POST THIS ON GITHUB)
1) Run pub.py in Pycharm (you should see it pushing files)
2) Run reader.py in Pycharm (you should see that it receives the tweets)
3) Run your pipeline in the terminal
    a)  pipeline.py: python pipeline.py --topic projects/dataengineering-course/topics/usdata --project dataengineering-course --dataset usdata --table_name posts --pid dataengineering-course --mbucket ass_2
        This pipeline is the most up to date, which currently gives the NotImportedError because of the Preprocessing part.
        I know it downloads the model, which it should do (which happens in the Prediction, so after the Preprocessing????)
    b)  pipeline2510.py: python pipeline2510.py --topic projects/dataengineering-course/topics/usdata --project dataengineering-course --dataset usdata --table_name posts --pid dataengineering-course --mbucket ass_2
        This is the pipeline from 25-10 where you can see tweets attempting to go through the pipeline, which gives errors because they are not processed blabla
        I included this one because I feel like it is a more basic form, and I maybe already messed up the pipeline.py
