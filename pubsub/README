0) Change the keyfile to your own key file (DO NOT POST THIS ON GITHUB)
1) Run pub.py in Pycharm (you should see it pushing files)
2) Run reader.py in Pycharm (you should see that it receives the tweets)
3) Run your pipeline in the terminal, the most up to date (and seems to be working) is sentiment_pipeline.py
python sentiment_pipeline.py --topic projects/dataengineering-course/topics/election_data --project dataengineering-course --subscription projects/dataengineering-course/subscriptions/election_data_sub --dataset US_election_data --table_name tweet_info
